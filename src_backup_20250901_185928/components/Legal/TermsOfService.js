                <strong>Not Real Financial Advice:</strong> Our AI advisors are very smart, but they're 
                not licensed financial advisors, lawyers, or fortune tellers. Don't bet your house on 
                what Mark Cuban's AI says about your startup. üé∞
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>AI Can Be Creative:</strong> Sometimes our AI advisors get a little too creative 
                and might make up facts, statistics, or even entire companies. Always verify important 
                information before making decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>No Warranty:</strong> We provide this service "as is" - like a prototype you 
                found in a garage. It might be brilliant, it might be quirky, but we can't guarantee 
                it won't occasionally suggest pivoting to a pet rock business.

              <p>
                <strong>Be Cool:</strong> Use the platform for legitimate business purposes. Don't try 
                to break it, hack it, or use it to plan world domination (unless it's a legitimate 
                business plan).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Respect Others:</strong> If you're sharing access with team members, be respectful. 
                No spam, no harassment, no asking the AI to roast your competitors (tempting, we know).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Stay Legal:</strong> Don't use the platform for anything illegal, unethical, 
                or that would make your grandmother disappointed in you.
