## Project Vision & Philosophy

The V21 AI Board of Advisors represents a paradigm shift in executive advisory services. We're building a platform that democratizes access to C-suite level strategic guidance through AI-powered advisors that can analyze documents, participate in virtual meetings, and provide actionable insights tailored to each business's unique challenges.

Our core philosophy centers on three principles:

**Accessibility**: Small and medium businesses deserve the same quality of strategic advice as Fortune 500 companies. Our platform makes this possible through AI that embodies the expertise of seasoned executives.

**Intelligence**: Every interaction should feel like speaking with a real advisory board. Our AI advisors don't just respond - they analyze, synthesize, and provide contextual insights based on uploaded documents and conversation history.

**Modularity**: The platform grows with user needs. Starting with basic chat, users can progressively unlock document analysis, video meetings, custom advisors, and advanced analytics - all without overwhelming new users.

## Core Architecture Principles

These principles are inviolable. Any new feature or modification must respect these boundaries:

### 1. The Core Shell is Sacred
The Core Shell (CS21-v1) provides the foundational structure for the entire application. It manages navigation, module loading, and provides the consistent frame within which all modules operate. Think of it as the operating system for your advisory platform.

**What the Core Shell handles:**
- Primary navigation through the sidebar
- Module loading and unloading
- Global state coordination
- User authentication flow
- Settings management
- Voice command routing

**What the Core Shell does NOT do:**
- Process business logic
- Make API calls directly
- Manage module-specific state
- Handle document processing
- Control AI interactions

### 2. Module Independence and Boundaries
Each module is a self-contained unit that operates within its designated container. Modules can read from shared state but must communicate changes only through the established context system.

**Module Contract:**
- Modules must export a default React component
- Modules cannot modify the DOM outside their container
- Modules cannot import from other modules directly
- Modules must handle their own error states
- Modules should gracefully degrade when services are unavailable

### 3. Context-Driven State Management
All shared state flows through React Context providers. This creates a predictable data flow and ensures modules remain decoupled while still being able to share information.

**Context Hierarchy:**
```
App
├── SupabaseContext (Authentication & Backend)
├── AppStateContext (Application State)
└── VoiceContext (Voice/Speech Services)
    └── Individual Modules (consume contexts)
```

### 4. Service Layer Abstraction
Services provide the interface between the application and external systems. They must be stateless, substitutable, and handle their own error conditions.

**Service Principles:**
- Services never store state internally
- Services can be mocked for testing
- Services handle API errors gracefully
- Services return consistent data shapes
- Services can be enhanced without breaking contracts

## System Architecture Overview

The V21 platform follows a layered architecture pattern that separates concerns and enables independent scaling of different system aspects:

```

### Data Flow Patterns

Understanding how data flows through the system is crucial for maintaining architectural integrity:

**User Action Flow:**
1. User interacts with a module component
2. Module dispatches action to AppStateContext
3. Reducer updates state based on action
4. All modules receive updated state via context
5. Relevant modules re-render with new data

**Service Integration Flow:**
1. Module calls service method
2. Service makes external API call
3. Service processes response into consistent format
4. Service returns data or throws error
5. Module updates local state or dispatches to context

## State Management Strategy

The AppStateContext serves as the single source of truth for application state. Understanding its structure is essential for maintaining data consistency across modules.

### State Structure
```javascript
{
  // Document Management
  documents: [
    {
      id: string,
      name: string,
      type: string,
      size: number,
      status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'processed' | 'error',
      content: string,
      extractedData: object,
      analysis: object,
      created_at: string
    }
  ],
  selectedDocument: object | null,
  documentsLoading: boolean,
  
  // Advisor Management
  advisors: Array<Advisor>,          // Default advisors
  customAdvisors: Array<Advisor>,    // User-created advisors
  selectedAdvisors: Array<string>,   // Currently active advisor IDs
  advisorsLoading: boolean,
  
  // Conversation Management
  conversations: Array<Conversation>,
  activeConversation: object | null,
  conversationMessages: Array<Message>,
  conversationsLoading: boolean,
  
  // Meeting State
  isMeetingActive: boolean,
  meetingTranscript: Array<Message>,
  meetingDocuments: Array<Document>,
  
  // User & Subscription
  user: object | null,
  subscription: object | null,
  
  // UI State

  // Settings
  settings: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark',
    voiceEnabled: boolean,
    autoSave: boolean,
    notificationsEnabled: boolean
  }
}
```

### Action Patterns
Actions follow a consistent naming convention that indicates their purpose:

```javascript
// Document Actions
SET_DOCUMENTS        // Replace entire documents array
ADD_DOCUMENT         // Add single document
UPDATE_DOCUMENT      // Update specific document
DELETE_DOCUMENT      // Remove document
SELECT_DOCUMENT      // Set active document

// Async State Actions
SET_[RESOURCE]_LOADING   // Set loading state
SET_[RESOURCE]_ERROR     // Set error state

// Bulk Operations
RESET_STATE          // Clear all state
LOAD_USER_DATA       // Initialize from backend
```

## Development Guidelines

These guidelines ensure consistent, maintainable code that respects the architectural principles:

### Adding New Features

When implementing new functionality, follow this decision tree:

1. **Can it be done within an existing module?**
   - Yes: Enhance the module following its existing patterns
   - No: Continue to step 2

2. **Does it require a new module?**
   - Yes: Create new module following naming convention
   - No: Continue to step 3

3. **Does it require a new service?**
   - Yes: Create service with clear interface
   - No: Enhance existing service with new methods

### Code Organization

Maintain consistent file structure:
```
feature/
├── components/          # React components
│   ├── FeatureName.js  # Main component
│   └── subcomponents/  # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── utils/              # Helper functions
└── index.js           # Module exports
```

### Testing Strategy

Before integrating any new feature:
1. Test in isolation with mock data
2. Test with real services in demo mode
3. Test error conditions and edge cases
4. Test performance with large datasets
5. Test on mobile viewports

### Version Control

When updating modules:
```
modules/
├── ModuleName-CS21-v1/  # Current stable
├── ModuleName-CS21-v2/  # New features (in development)
└── ModuleName-CS21-v3/  # Future version (planned)
```

Never modify v1 once stable. Create v2 for enhancements.

```
ModuleName-CS[ShellVersion]-v[Major].[Minor].[Patch]

CS21 = Core Shell version 21
v1.0.0 = Module version

Major: Breaking changes
Minor: New features
Patch: Bug fixes
```

### Git Branch Strategy
```
main            # Production-ready code
develop         # Integration branch
feature/*       # New features
hotfix/*        # Emergency fixes
release/*       # Release preparation
```

### Deployment Strategy
```
Local Development → Staging → Production

1. Feature flags control rollout
2. Canary deployments for risky changes
3. Automatic rollback on errors
4. Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
```

## Migration Strategies

When upgrading modules or core systems:

### Data Migration
```javascript
// migrations/v1-to-v2.js
export async function migrateV1toV2(oldState) {
  return {
    ...oldState,
    // Add new fields with defaults
    newFeature: false,
    enhancedData: processOldData(oldState.data)
  };
}
```

### Module Migration
1. Create new version alongside old
2. Add feature flag to switch versions
3. Run both in parallel for testing
4. Gradually migrate users
5. Deprecate old version

### Service Migration
1. Implement adapter pattern
2. Support both old and new APIs
