# Archive - Future Vision Documents

This folder contains documents that describe features and implementations that were planned but not yet built. These represent the product vision and can be referenced for future development.

## Why These Were Archived

These documents described V21 as if it were fully implemented, which caused confusion between what was planned vs. what was actually built. By moving them here, we maintain clarity about the current state while preserving the vision.

## Archived Documents Should Include:

1. **V21 Complete Feature Deployment.txt** - Describes unbuilt features
2. **V21 Automated Setup Script.txt** - References non-existent components  
3. **V21 Document Hub Module.txt** - Complex features not implemented
4. **V21 Advisory Hub Module.txt** - Full implementation that doesn't exist
5. **V21 Meeting Hub Module.txt** - Video integration not built
6. **V21 Document Processor Service.txt** - Complex OCR/processing not implemented
7. **V21 Deepgram Voice Service.txt** - Using browser Speech API instead
8. **V21 Voice Context.txt** - If it's the complex version

## How to Use These Documents

- **For Planning**: Reference when building new features
- **For Investors**: Show the full product vision
- **For Development**: Use as specifications when implementing
- **For Estimates**: Understand scope of remaining work

## Current Reality

See `/docs/V21-Implementation-Status.md` for what's actually built and working.
